# STREAK CAMERA REFERENCE MEASUREMENTS

A laser pulse is shined on the camera in order to simulate the light from the protons on the screen. The length seems to be something like 500 ps. This is acceptable compared to the ~1ns of the protons. 

FOLDER LIST:
- Photodiode-on-LeCroy-18GHz: data from the lecroy scope from the fast photodiode. 6.5 bits, 18 GHz BW, 60 GSas. The light was shined with no filters. 

- Photodiode-on-Tek-6GHz: data from the Tektronix scope 6 GHz, 25 GSas from the fast photodiode.

- Photodiode-on-Tek-12bit-4GHz: data from the Tektronix scope 4 GHz but 12 bit mode. Fast photodiode.

- Old-photodiode-on-Tek: the slow photodiode of Ishkhan and Stefano. Tek scope.
